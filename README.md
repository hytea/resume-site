### Resume

The main idea of the website is to showcase a resume and only have to update it in one place. The resume is written in the site config.json (see below for detailed documentation) and is then automatically converted to a PDF when the user clicks the download button.

## ðŸ›  Configuration

The website configuration can be managed via the `config.json` file located in the `public` directory. This allows for easy updates to the resume content without modifying the HTML directly.

### Configurable Sections

1. **Experience:**

   - **title**: Job title
   - **dateRange**: Duration of the job
   - **company**: Name of the company
   - **location**: Job location
   - **responsibilities**: List of responsibilities

2. **Skills:**
   You can add zero or more skills sections. The title of the section is the key and the value is the content. The key should use underscores instead of spaces and all the correct capitalization as you would like it to appear on the resume. You can also use HTML tags to style the content. For example, you can use `<span class="feature">` to feature some important text.

3. **Education:**
   - **degree**: Degree obtained
   - **date**: Graduation date
   - **institution**: Name of the institution
   - **location**: Location of the institution
